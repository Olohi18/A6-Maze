Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials: None--- I did this assignment without AI ðŸŽŠ. I really enjoy recursion. Apart from googling syntax, like the syntax for appending to a new arraylist in JAVA, I didn't use a lot of online resources.

Do you have any remaining questions about this assignment?
I'm usnsure how to use the mazeViewer in my solveMaze class. I would like to see you regarding it-- it doesn't display anything. I wonder if there's an issue with how I implemented the main method in my solveMaze class.
Other questions:
--- While we aren't required to know this for the assignment, how does the mazeContent initialization actually work?
--- If we return False when we hit a wall, don't the recursion stop?

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
I enjoyed this assignment. I would love to do more with recursion and wish we could explore it for an extra week, but this is amazing already. Thanks, Halie!
